        <h1 id="H" >Web Development</h1>
        <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet
            (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text
            to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list
            of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content
            development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security
            configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>
            <br>

        <p>Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
            sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
            content changes easier and available with basic technical skills</p>
            <br>
        <p>
            For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
            developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
            organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
            related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a
            collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three
            kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.
            Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end
            developers deal with the servers.

        <h1 id="H" >C language</h1>
        <p>The C Programming Language (sometimes termed K&R, after its authors' initials) is a computer programming book
            written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the
            language, as well as co-designed the Unix operating system with which development of the language was
            closely intertwined. The book was central to the development and popularization of the C programming
            language and is still widely read and used today. Because the book was co-authored by the original language
            designer, and because the first edition of the book served for many years as the de facto standard for the
            language, the book was regarded by many to be the authoritative reference on C.[</p>
            <br>
        <p>C was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s as an augmented version of Ken Thompson's
            B.[3] Another Bell Labs employee, Brian Kernighan, had written the first C tutorial,[4] and he persuaded
            Ritchie to coauthor a book on the language.[5] Kernighan would write most of the book's "expository"
            material, and Ritchie's reference manual became its appendices.

            The first edition, published February 22, 1978, was the first widely available book on the C programming
            language. Its version of C is sometimes termed K&R C (after the book's authors), often to distinguish this
            early version from the later version of C standardized as ANSI C.[6]</p>
            <br>
        <p>In April 1988, the second edition of the book was published, updated to cover the changes to the language
            resulting from the then-new ANSI C standard, particularly with the inclusion of reference material on
            standard libraries. The second edition of the book (and as of 2021, the most recent) has since been
            translated into over 20 languages. In 2012, an eBook version of the second edition was published in ePub,
            Mobi, and PDF formats.

        <h1 id="H" >C++ language</h1>
        <p>The C++ Programming Language is a computer programming book first published in October 1985. It was the first
            book to describe the C++ programming language, written by the language's creator, Bjarne Stroustrup. In the
            absence of an official standard, the book served for several years as the de facto documentation for the
            evolving C++ language, until the release of the ISO/IEC 14882:1998: Programming Language C++ standard on 1
            September 1998. As the standard further evolved with the standardization of language and library extensions
            and with the publication of technical corrigenda, later editions of the book were updated to incorporate the
            new changes.</p>
            <br>
        <p>The third edition of the book was first published on 30 June 1997; a hardcover version of the third edition,
            with two new appendices, was later published as The C++ Programming Language: Special Edition on 11 February
            2000. Both the softcover third edition and the hardcover “special edition” have since undergone several
            reprintings, with corrections.[2]</p>
            <br>
        <p>C++ Solutions (ISBN 0-201-30965-3) is a companion book to the third edition of The C++ Programming Language.
            It contains solutions to selected exercises of The C++ Programming Language.

            The fourth edition of the book, which incorporates C++11, was released on May 19, 2013.[3]</p>
